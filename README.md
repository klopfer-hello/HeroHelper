## HeroHelper

A simple TBC Classic Anniversary addon that tells Shamans **when** to cast Heroism / Bloodlust on every raid and dungeon boss.

<br clear="left"/>

No more checking the spreadsheet between pulls. No more "wait, was I supposed to lust this one?". A glowing reminder pops up at the right moment. Cast your Heroism/Bloodlust the way you normally do, and keep DPS'ing.

*The reminder pops up when it's time to cast. HeroHelper is purely a timing indicator — you cast Heroism / Bloodlust however you already have it bound.*

### What it does

- Watches every raid pull and every dungeon boss.
- Pops a glowing reminder at the moment your raid wants Heroism — on the pull, at a specific HP%, when a phase starts, after a set time, or any combination.
- Stays out of your way the rest of the time. Hidden until needed, fades out after the cast.
- Purely a timing indicator — the addon never casts for you, so there's no click-through risk and no combat-lockdown surprises. You trigger Heroism / Bloodlust the way you always do (action bar, keybind, whatever).
- Knows about every boss in **all nine TBC raids** and **every TBC 5-man dungeon**, with researched defaults out of the box.
- Coordinates with **other shamans in your group** so two of you don't waste a Heroism on the same pull.

### How to use it

**1. Install.** Drop the `HeroHelper` folder into `Interface/AddOns/`, or grab the latest release from CurseForge.

**2. Position the reminder.** Type `/hh` to open the options.

![Options panel](media/screenshots/screenshot-options-general.png)

- In the **General** tab, choose your sound and (if you raid with another shaman) pick your role: *Primary*, *Secondary*, *Backup*, or *Auto*.
- Type `/hh test` once to show the reminder, drag it where you want it, then `/hh test` again to hide it.

**3. Pick your triggers.** Open the **Bosses** tab.

Each boss has a default trigger that should be sensible for most raids. You can change any of them:

- **Pull** — fires the reminder the moment you engage the boss.
- **HP %** — fires when the boss drops below a chosen HP percentage (good for execute phases).
- **Time** — fires a fixed number of seconds after the pull.
- **Multi** — fires on the *first* of multiple conditions you pick (e.g. *HP 25% or 90 seconds in*).
- **Skip** — don't fire for this boss.
- **Off** — disable the reminder for this boss entirely.

Click **Export** to copy your settings as a share string and send them to the rest of your raid. They click **Import** and you're synced.

**4. Pull a boss.** When the reminder pops, cast Heroism / Bloodlust however you normally do it (action bar, keybind, macro — whatever you already have set up). The addon never casts for you; it just tells you *when*.

### Coordinating with other shamans

By default, every HeroHelper-using shaman fires their own reminder. When you want to lock in who Heroes, someone types `/hh roster lock` — that freezes the current roster, announces the resolved order to group chat, and from then on only the elected shaman's reminder fires. If that shaman dies mid-fight, the reminder automatically jumps to the next-priority alive shaman (Primary > Secondary > Backup).

Each shaman sets their **role** in the General tab before the lock:

- **Primary** — elected first when alive.
- **Secondary** — elected if Primary is dead.
- **Backup** — elected if Primary and Secondary are dead.
- **Auto** — no explicit role; alphabetical tiebreak only.

Type `/hh roster unlock` to drop the lock and go back to everyone firing independently. `/hh roster` on its own shows the current state — locked or live, roster contents, and the current elected winner.

### About the cast

HeroHelper never casts Heroism / Bloodlust for you — it's purely a timing reminder. Cast the spell the way you already do: action bar click, keybind, personal macro, whatever. Keeping the cast out of the addon sidesteps all the TBC 2.5.5 combat-lockdown / protected-frame pitfalls (including the click-through bug where clicks under a hidden reminder could fire BL onto raid frames).

---

### Compatibility

- **Game version**: TBC Classic Anniversary (2.5.5)
- **Addon version**: 2.0.1
- Works on its own. Plays nicely with **BigWigs** and **DBM** if you have them.
